This is a case study that I completed as part of my capstone project in the last step of obtaining my Google Data Analytics professional certificate. I have replicated this project, each time using different tools like SQL, Tableau, Spreadsheets, or Google Slides but here you can find the version of this case study that I undertook using R to process, manipulate data and create powerful visuals which can be used to drive insight.

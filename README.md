# Case Study of Cyclistic Ride Share Data with R

This is a case study that I completed as part of my capstone project in the last step of obtaining my Google Data Analytics professional certificate. I have replicated this this case study multiple times, each time using different tools like SQL, Tableau, Spreadsheets, or Google Slides but here you can find the version of this case study that I completed using R to process, manipulate data and create powerful visuals which can be used to drive insight. 

***Background***

I'm a junior Data analyst working in the marketing department of a Chicago-based ride share company called Cyclistic. Senior marketing executives within the company believe that encouraging casual riders to purchase annual memberships to their customers will be lucrative for the company as it will drive a recurring revenue model. 

Currently the company has 3 products from which drive revenues at the company:
* Single-ride passes **(referred to as "casual users")**
* Full-day passes **(referred to as "casual users")**
* Annual memberships **(referred to as "members")**

In this version of my case study I chose R as my primary tool for processing 4,000,000+ rows of data and create visuals. Unlike with spreadsheets, I did not need to subsample my data since R is more than capable to process large amounts of raw data. Therefore, there is no benefit to the tradeoff of subsampling data in this case which can potentially introduce bias to our results. 

Raw data were obtained directly from Divvy and can be accessed via the link below:
